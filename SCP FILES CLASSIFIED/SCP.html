 <h1> SCP:SCP-4834 </h1>
 <h2> Log: [Deleted] </h2> 
 <h2 style="color:#FFFF00;"> Object Class: Euclid </h2>	 
<br>
<br>


<p>Special Containment Procedures:</p> 
<p> SCP-4834 is to be kept in a secure object container with one Xyank-Anastankos Constant Temporal Sink mounted on the outside at all times. SCP-4834-1 through SCP-4834-5 are to be watched by agents in their respective areas. No entry is to be allowed at any time. </p>

<p> Description: </p> <p> <br>
SCP-4834 is the corpse of Temporal Studies Researcher Christopher Ferris, a former Foundation employee, who died on January 13, 2016. Despite this, Ferris' corpse was unable to be recovered until October 13, 2018. <br> <br>
<br> <br>
SCP-4834 has a damaged Xyank Temporal Manipulator (XTM) embedded in its arm that generates a temporal desynchronization field around SCP-4834. As a result, SCP-4834 is unaffected by the flow of time in the area around it, and it has remained unchanged since Ferris' death. SCP-4834 will teleport to a set of five locations when uncontained. Upon arriving at a location, SCP-4834 will cause one of two different additional timelines, designated Timeline A and Timeline B, to appear and overwrite the baseline timeline. Neither of these timelines are the baseline timeline, and locations will revert back to the baseline after SCP-4834 teleports to a new location. SCP-4834 will remain in a location until disturbed, at which point it will teleport to a different location out of the five. <br> <br>
<br> <br>
On January 11, 2016, Site-26 Director Matthews received a message on their computer reading "Watch where Ferris goes" with a send date of October 17, 2018. Director Matthews dispatched a security team to apprehend Ferris and examine the data on his XTM. Ferris attempted to flee Site-26, and was presumed dead two days later when he vanished from inside his car while fleeing agents. Three hours later, a team was sent to investigate Ferris' car and witnessed him reappearing by his car soon after arrival, opening fire on him and killing him. One of the rounds struck his XTM during this engagement, damaging it. At this point, SCP-4834 gained its anomalous properties, and teleported away. It was not recovered until being intercepted at SCP-4834-5 on October 13, 2018. <br> <br>
<br> <br>
Following Ferris' death, investigations into his activities revealed that he had been using Foundation-sanctioned trips and his XTM for unauthorized purposes, deviating from his set travel path to instead visit several locations unrelated to his work in the Department of Temporal Studies. Ferris recorded his trips to these locations, and is suspected to have interfered heavily in past events multiple times in each location. His interference is suspected to have caused severe damage to the timeline, possibly having caused a TM-Class Restoration Event where all evidence of his interference was removed from the main timeline. The collateral damage of this event is unclear. <br> <br>
<br> <br>
SCP-4834 has teleported to five locations, designated SCP-4834-1 through SCP-4834-5. All information on the instances was gathered by exploration teams in the time period between Ferris' death and SCP-4834's containment. <br> <br>

 <h1> SCP:-4972 </h1>
 <h2> Log: [Found] </h2> 
 <h2 style="color:#0000FF;"> Object Class: Unknown </h2>	


	
 <p> <b> Special Containment Procedures: </b> </p> <p> The Adaptive Containment Chamber (ACC) SCP-4972 is believed to reside in is to remain in the section of Site-22 it was first found in. This ACC is to be kept under guard by a security team of at least ten personnel at all times. No attempts are to be made, outside of already agreed testing protocol, to observe or access the interior of the ACC. </p> <br> <br>
<br> <br> <br>
<p> Any approved attempts to access the interior of the ACC through testing are to be done according to this procedure: <br> <br> <br>

	All testing is to be performed by a single member of D-Class personnel. <br> <br>
	No recording devices are to observe the testing process. <br><br>
	All security personnel are to turn away from the ACC during the moment of entry, and noise-cancellation headgear is to be activated until the ACC is resealed. <br><br>
	The amount of time the D-Class operative is to remain in the ACC is to be specified beforehand. The D-Class operative is not to be released until this time has been reached. In the event that a D-Class operative does not attempt to leave once this time has been reached, the ACC is to remain sealed. <br><br>
	Following emergence from the ACC, the D-Class is to be decontaminated, scanned remotely for bodily anomalies and interviewed by Dr. Carè. Interview is to take place in a sealed interview room, with the interviewer and subject in separated sections. <br><br>
	Until the interview has been concluded and the D-Class in question has been confirmed non-compromised, no individuals are to make any form of direct contact with them. <br><br>
	Once testing is concluded and all relevant information logged, the D-Class is to be administered a Class-A amnestic to excise any memory of said test. <br><br> <br> <br> <br>
<br>All information gained from D-Class testing is to be accessed only by Dr. Carè. In the event of his death or otherwise becoming incapable of performing his duties, access is to pass to the next highest ranking member of research personnel. </p>
<br> <br> <br> <p> <b> Description: </b> </p> <p> SCP-4972 is an object, entity or phenomenon presumed to exist within an Adaptive Containment Chamber located at Site-22. </p> <br> <br>
<br> <br> <br>
<p> <b> Discovery: </b> </p> <p>The existence of SCP-4972 was first discovered during a routine system scan of Site-22. It was discovered that, since previous checks had been performed, an unused section was draining large amounts of power from the site's generators. Upon investigation, the ACC was discovered in the area in question, with the designation <br> <br> emblazoned on its side indicating it was containing SCP-4972. The ACC is an experimental containment chamber designed for secure storage of Red Threat Level anomalies. Note that a prototype for the ACC had not yet been completed when SCP-4972 was found. <br> <br>
No individuals stationed at Site-22 could explain how the ACC was transported into Site-22, and mnestic therapy of numerous personnel proved that no memories existed of the ACC's arrival. In addition, no personnel could explain why the section of Site-22 the ACC was found in had been unused for such a long period of time. </p> <br> <br>
